The purpose of this project is to create a website to challenge the user about their engagement of short form media they watch on TikTok, Youtube Shorts, Instagram Reels or any other version.
Try and remember the last thing you watched from the last short form content. Now try and remember anything you learnt from all those hours wasted just doomscrolling.

The objectives are to build an application to help the user remember what they watch by accessing the list of short form videos and asking the user what they remember through summary.
Then, I may take a random video thumbnail and see if they remember the contents of that video.
If I have time, I may look into making an android application to remind you to be aware and scroll mindfully.

Inspired by (oddly enough) a CheeseParade youtube shorts skit.
